This is a single page application (SPA) for my poet/author daughter.
Nothing fancy.
index.html is the entire site except for the images folde and a pdf or two.

The initial page was created by Google Gemini. See "saved files/original-site-page."

I have modified to suite. See index.html.

You can see the end product by opening the index page in your browser.

My goal was to make a simple site that my npn-technical daughter could maintain.

Tutorial.html is my attempt at documentation. Userguide.md is the contents of the tutorial.

The images folder contains the site images plus the tutorial images in the help folder.

The saved files folders is just a local backup . . .
