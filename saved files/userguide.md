## Single Page Site Users Guide  

This document attempts to teach you how modify and add to your new website.  
The entire website is contained in a single web page - index.html. The core code was originally generated by Google Gemini and modified by Dad.

The web page, like all web pages is written in the HTML markup language.  
HTML is simple once you study it a little.

For a good introduction see see this on w3schools: [HTML introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

The best way to follow this tutorial is by having the site displayed in another browser tab. Seeing the code and the web pages makes things clearer. Also study the website.html file starting at the body tag.

### The Menu Bar 

The menu bar contains links to all of the sites pages via buttons.  
Here's an image of most of the menu bar:

![Menu](./images/help/navbar.png) 

Note the first "nav-link" line:

`<li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" onclick="showPage('home')">home</a></li>`

"onclick="show-page('home')" invokes a "function" that displays the home page when the home button is clicked.

The 'home' in parentheses  is the "id" of the home page section.

The home in angle brackets is the button caption.

You will notice one of these "li" tags for each page in the site.

Note the frst "li class="nav-item dropdown" tag. This starts a dropdown menu in the nav bar. The next line defines the books button and the next line defines the dropdown menu itself.

Each if the li tags defines the selection for the named poem in the dropdown menu.

### The Pages

Each page in the site is wrapped in an HTML section tag and each section tag has an "id" attribute that identifys the page. 

Here is an image of the the home page. Note the id in the section tag:

![Home Page](./images/help/home.png)

The first div tag defines a container for a row of elements.

The next div defines a container for a column for the keft site and it contains an img - image tag -  that holds the left hand image on the page.

The img tag has a "src" attribute that identifys the image file. In particular, this img displays the "Website_Name_Plate.jpg" in the images folder.

The final div wraps the right hand image of Sharla.

The about page has the same layout with an image of Sharla in the first (left)} div and the about text in the second (right) div.

Next we will look at a centered poem page:

![Centered Poem Page](./images/help/poem-centered.png)

The first\<div\> holds the poem title - I Wonder . . . in this case, wrapped in an \<h5\> tag.

The next \<div\> wraps the poem code in a centered text container that scrolls if too long.

The poem text itself is wrapped in  \<p\> (paragraph) that holda a block of text with \<br\> (break) tags at the end of each line to maintain the poem layout.

The paragraph tag exposes probably what is the major complaint about HTML; It's handling of plain text is miserable and no one has bothered to fix this in all these years. Thus we have to resort to "hacks." In this case, replacing all of the line ends with the poem's text with the HTML line break (\<br\> tag that acts like carriage returns in normal text.

 If you are writing with Word you can add all of these break tags using the search and replace dialog as folows to replace the line ends:
 
1. Select the text of the poem.
2. Run the Find & Replace dialog.
3. In Find What, enter "^p."   no quotes.
4. In Replace With, enter "\<br\>p".
5. Click Replace All.

The \<br\> tag should appear at the end of each line and in each blank line and in empty lines.

If you write with Libre Office the find and replace is different. Google it . . . 

When adding the poem to the webb, site just select the poem paragraph in the web page,  copy from from your Word doc and paste it over the selected  text in the paragraph tag.

### Now it' Time to Add New Poems to the Website  
Adding a new poem is simple enough. You just copy and paste an existing poem section, edit it then
add a link to it in the navbar menu so it shows up in the menu bar.

The site accomodates two poem formats:  
1. The centered squiggely poem so popular today.
2. The traditional flush left poem. The text is centered pn the page but flush on it's left side.

##### Add a New CENTERED Poem to The Website

1. Copy a poem section - maybe  I Wonder - and paste it  just below. This is simplest as we are keeping all of the poems together.
2. Change the id to something meanngful.
2. Change the text in the H5 tag - I Woncder . . . in this case, to the new poem's title.
3. Select the I Wonder text and paste your break infested text of the new poem.
4. Move to the navbar text near the top of the file and find the poems
dropdown.
5. Copy and paste the last poem's li tag like"  
`<li><a class="dropdown-item py-2" onclick="showPage('steinway')">The Woman at the Steinway</a></li>`
6. Edit the copy to like this:  
`<li><a class="dropdown-item py-2" onclick="showPage('the new id')">The New Title</a></li>`
7. Open the website page in your browser and make sure the changes work.  


**Note:** The titles use the HTML "\<H\>" tags that produce bold text of different sizes. The tags range from \<H1\> to \<H6\> with \<H1\> being largest and \<H6\> being smallest with an automatic line break after them. The tags are not case sensitive and and end tag is required like: `<h1> some text </h1>`.

 
##### Add a New FLUSH LEFT Poem to The Website  

Adding a flush poem is exactly like adding a centered one. Immediately following the "Woman at The Steinway" section there is a section containing Robert Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken." It is there as a flush sample in case you come up
with some flush poems . . .

Copy and paste it and make the same changes as above for I Wonder.

**Note:** When you want to hide the flush sample just comment out it's \<li\> tag in the poems dropdown of the menui bar code like this:

`<!--<li><a class="dropdown-item py-2" onclick="showPage('flush')">Sample Flush Left Poem</a></li>-->`

### How to Add New Books to the Site

As released, the site contains only onr book page - American Woman Suspended - and we will use it as an example of adding a new book.

The process is just like adding a poem - Copy and paste a book section and edit to fit your new book.

Here's a sample of a book \<section\>:

![Sample Book Code](./images/help/book-sample.png)

The first \<div\> tag defines a scrolling container followed by a \<row\> tag that further wraps the contents. The next \<div\> defines a column 5 units wide that contains the book cover image (images/awscover.jpg) .

The next \<div\> defines a 7 unit column that holds the page text followed by an \<h4\> tag labeling the summary area folllowed by a paragraph holding the summary text.

Another \<h4\> labels the excerpt area. followed by the excerpt paragraphs.

**Note** the \<a\>tag in the first line of the excerpt. This is an HTML "anchor" tag. Anchors contain links to other web pages, areas of the current page or files. This particular anchor refers the the "AWSExcerpts-All.PDF" file  in the main site folder. When that anchor is clicked, the entire excerpt from the book is displayed in a new browser tab. 

To complete adding the new book you need to copy, paste and edit an \<li\> under the books dropdown in the menu bar.

### How to Add New Publications to the LPS Publications Page

The Live Poets Society pages have their own dropdown menu in the menu bar and their own \<section\> format. Here is the code through the first publication on the page - A Quiet Wind Speaks:

![Sample Book Code](./images/help/sample-lps-publication.png)

By now the code should begin to be somewhat readable . . . :})

Things of note:

1. The \<div\> that contains the image contains class "floated-image". This styling causes the image to lock onto the upper left  corner of the containing \<div\> with the class "editorial-text". It also causes the following text to wrap itself around the image.
2. The text is made up of paragraphs (\<div\> ... \</div\>) This seperates the text without using the break tags as we did in the poem code.
3. The publication's code ends with \<hr\> followed by a break. The \<hr\> tag causes a solid line across the page. This provides a clean break between the publications.

Like every page

1. You need an id in the section tag.
2. You need a list item (\<li\>) in the menu bar for this page.
